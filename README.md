EE3-Builds
==========

Builds from Pahimar's Equivalent Exchange 3. These builds should work, but are certainly not bug free and not (yet) functional.

Build pre2a-mod-1:

This is a modded version of Equivalent Exchange 3! This version adds the Energy Condenser from Equivalent Exchange 2 and adds more EMC values to items/blocks. THIS IS TEMPORARILY AVAILIBLE. This version will be deleted when Pahimar's version has a use for EMC. This is NOT Pahimar's implementation of EMC.
